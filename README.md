# GS-DOS Terminal Interface Project

This project is a terminal-like interface built with Node.js and Express.js. The application simulates a command-line environment in the browser, where users can execute commands such as `ls`, `cd`, and `help`. The project is designed to be both a fun and educational tool, showcasing how traditional terminal commands can be replicated in a web environment.

## Features

- **Command-Line Interface:** Execute commands like `ls`, `cd`, `help`, and more.
- **Dynamic Directory Navigation:** Navigate through directories just like in a real terminal.
- **Help Command:** Display helpful information and command usage instructions.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **NPM:** Node.js comes with NPM (Node Package Manager) installed. Make sure itâ€™s available by running `npm -v` in your terminal.
